# Development history

## 2026-10-30 - Before Parts 00-01 (preserved baseline)

- 81485f6: initial procedural Bevy/Rapier racing prototype and nine tests.
- 03f12b2: corrected steering; physical scenery/vehicle interactions, attacker
  launch/bounce, ragdoll-follow camera, assisted get-up/run/remount, synthesized
  audio with existing CPAL ALSA recovery patch; 18 behavior tests recorded.
- a0902c9: preserved supplied blueprint and created README's 17-part checklist.

## 2026-10-30 - Parts 00-01 implementation

- Created permanent agent/progress/decision/known-issue/testing/provenance records,
  short prioritized GDD, one-page slice contract, content sheets and 23 immutable
  documentary research observations. No original game media/code imported.
- Added real core/content workspace libraries; retained compatible engine/physics
  pins after checking the newer plugin manifests. Created subsystem plugins and
  Boot/Loading/MainMenu/Race/Results lifecycle.
- Moved gameplay and Rapier into explicit 60 Hz fixed scheduling; buffered input
  edges before the loop and interpolated render-only children/camera afterward.
- Added validated authored IDs/tuning/keyboard bindings, legacy-safe schema-1
  profiles, local panic reports, F3 CPU/wall/fixed/entity/collider diagnostics,
  optional physics visualization and minimal offline feature build.
- Added Linux/Windows CI builds/headless tests and declared-license/media/research
  audits; excluded optional unverified LUT media and retained the OFL font notice.
- New acceptance tests cover 30/60/120 render rates, zero-tick input and 100
  crash/pause/resume/reset cycles. Execution receipts and remaining platform gates
  are recorded in testing/PARTS_00_01.md and PROGRESS.md.

- User-reported crash/recovery fixes: preserve momentum, choose separate clear
  rider placement, omit seated visuals from wrecks, remount at the rotated physical
  shape, stop runner impulse chasing and protect shoulder damage after remount.
  Repeat knockdowns use current runner velocity.
  Added raw velocity/separation and twelve fallen-bike approach regressions.

This entry describes implementation; only explicit receipts close acceptance.
No later gameplay part is automatically completed by this foundation work.

## 2026-10-30 - User fixes and Part 02 scenic point-to-point graybox

- User rejected a proposed return loop: shipped route is farmland -> city -> hills,
  with distinct start/finish and no endpoint wrap. Previous closed handling road
  remains only as an additional regression/tuning fixture.
- Added validated schema-1 authoring, Catmull-Rom centerline/width/bank/elevation/
  sectors, 3D arc length, ordered physical gates and endpoint/retry behavior.
- Added independent road meshes/collision, bank-safe terrain, seeded farm dressing,
  solid cows/lift contacts, city buildings/cross traffic/walking pedestrians and
  elevated hills/guardrails. Added CLI and F4 inspector; CI validates both tracks.
- Smooth boost release/exhaustion; positive grass movement, no grass-only damage;
  tighter data-driven steering with legacy catalog defaults.
- Replaced generic ragdoll ball limits with directional hinges, anatomical stops
  and bounded passive tissue motors. Wrecks slide on slopes, stop on flat ground,
  and remount height follows terrain. Retained controls/combat/audio/save behavior.
- Added full-route controller/gate test, endpoint/shortcut/import tests, road support
  rays, grass/boost/cow/ramp regressions, 100 physical drops and native farm/hill
  recovery + zone/inspector captures. See testing/PART_02.md for actual receipts.
- Branch/split/merge support and representative busy-race pacing remain explicitly
  incomplete; no automatic advancement to the next major production part.

- Prior foundation CI follow-up: Ubuntu passed; Windows builds/Rust tests passed
  but the metadata audit used cp1252. Switched metadata/text decoding to UTF-8,
  added a locale regression and kept the new remote acceptance gate open.
